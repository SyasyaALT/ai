"simple, virtual",549,Happiness' Premium Mooncake Gift Set,"Mid-Autumn Festival- Where we spend our time with family and friends

'Family is not an important thing. It's everything.' by Michael J. Fox

The mid-autumn festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar with a full moon at night. It is one of the important Chinese festivals, where family and members gather around enjoying some tea and mooncake underneath the moonlight, symbolizing reunion and harmony.

We love our families and friends, but let's face the truth; we barely make time for them. But, no worries, send some love to them during the mid-autumn festival and let them know you think of them. This gift box is unlike the other. Rather than the ordinary 4-piece mooncakes set that we usually see on hypermarket, surprise them with a thoughtful, curated premium mooncake gift box. No artificial flavouring, no artificial colouring and no preservative. Together with Ng Kee Cake House, one of the most established cake house in Penang, we have crafted four colourful contemporary yet authentic mooncake for you to gift to your love one because classic never goes out of style.

What's included?

Bottom Layer: 'Happiness' Mooncakes

1. Red Adzuki Bean Single Yolk Mooncake (80g): All-time favourite. The fresh red adzuki beans paste as well as salted egg yolks add a distinctive taste to a mooncake.
2. Mung Bean Single Yolk Mooncake (80g): The green bean paste with salted egg yolk are meant to devour together, delicious!
3. Black Sesame Mooncake (80g): Savour the delicate sweetness of black sesame paste filling in the perfectly baked white skin mooncake.
4. Taro Mooncake (80g): Taro is also known as Yam Mooncake, offers a smooth and dense texture amidst the yummy 'yammy' flavour that suits for contemporary palates.

‘Reminisce’ Premium Gift Set 众心伴月 (Zhòng xīn bàn yuè) 精美中秋礼盒

The Mid-Autumn Festival is also known as the Mooncake Festival, a traditional festival celebrated in Chinese culture.

We had that moment when a childhood memory would bring a smile to our faces. ‘Reminisce’ 众心伴月 (Zhòng xīn bàn yuè) is inspired by that exact moment. We intend to worship the moon during the mid-autumn season because the moon reminds people of their families and homelands and wishes them well. This leads to the symbolism of the Koi fish in the picture of family harmony and longevity.

Of course, mooncakes shouldn’t be left out during the moon-viewing during this festival! Send a ‘Reminisce’ gift set to your loved ones during the mid-autumn festival and let them know you think of them sincerely from the heart! Each mooncake is carefully handmade and crafted by a local Sifu who serves four colourful, contemporary yet authentic mooncakes for you to gift to your loved ones!

What is inside?

“工作称心” 黑芝麻精美月饼 ‘Best wishes for a career’, Black Sesame Single Yolk Mooncake (80g) x 1: Savour the delicate sweetness of black sesame paste filling and the grainy yet creamy salted egg yolk in the perfectly baked white skin mooncake.
